## Algorithms for bioinformatics
### First project in the course of algorithms for bioinformatics

In the first project I was tasked with creating matrix class and implement methods listed below:
1. Summing all values
2. Summing values in given row/column, creating list of summed values in the list
3. Finding min/max value
4. Calculate average value in matrix
5. Calculating average values in columns/rows
6. Checking if matrix is square
7. Multiplying matrix by numerical value
8. Add two martices
9. Multiply matrix by another matrix

Project also included creating simple tests in the form of assertions

### Second project

In the second project I was tasked with creating and presenting the usage of functions listed below:
1. "Randomly" generating DNA sequence (with an option to maniplate proportions of nucleotides)
2. Creating random mutations
3. Translating and transcribing it to protein sequence
4. Analysing sequences 
  - How DNA sequence changed and how it affected protein sequence
  - Listing the most often occuring patterns of given lenght (ex. 5)
  
 ### Third project
 
 In the third project I was tasked with creating function which reads FASTA file and returns the list of all sequences in it

### Forth project

In the forth project my goals were to:
1. Compare the execution time between recursive and itertion implementations of Fibonnaci series
2. Generate number of random coordinates in polar coordinates system and project them to cartesian
3. Explore how changing the number of samples affects the approximation of probability matrices
